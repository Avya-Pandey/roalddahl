                Roald Dahl is the greatest children`s author in the world. We know this because he has written so many children`s books during his lifetime. In total, he has written 20 books for children. It doesn`t stop there either; he has written countless short stories and books for adults too. This shows he was brilliant at what he did - writing books!

                Roald Dahl is known to be the best children`s author because he has won so many awards. In 2013, Dahl came top of a survey by a book selling company. He beat authors such as J.K.Rowling, Enid Blyton and Beatrix Potter. In the poll, Dahl was voted as the top author chosen by children (he gained 51% of their votes). He also secured 47% of the adult votes and won top author voted by adults too. This could possibly be because the adults had read Dahl`s books when they were children too!

                The fact that there is a museum all about Roald Dahl and his books in Buckinghamshire where he lived as an adult, also proves that he is a much-loved author. There you can see his original ideas and sketches based around the novels he wrote. Furthermore, you can even see where he wrote his books by visiting the reading room inside his house. It is well worth a visit!
